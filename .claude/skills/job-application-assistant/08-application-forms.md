# Application Form Fields

`/apply` produces two artifacts: a CV and a cover letter. Many applications need a **third** — free-text fields typed directly into an application portal. Graduate programs, large-employer ATS systems and startup forms routinely ask for things neither document covers, under a character or word limit, in a box with no formatting.

This file governs that third artifact. It is not a document you compile; it is text the candidate pastes.

## When this applies

Trigger it whenever a posting or portal asks for any of:

- A self-introduction / personal statement / "tell us about yourself" paragraph
- Structured project entries (project name, role, start and end date, description)
- A short pitch under a hard character limit ("stand out in 140 characters", "why you, in one sentence")
- Motivation questions ("why this company", "why this program")
- Competency questions with a word cap ("describe a time you…", 200 words)

## The rule that governs everything here

**Every claim in a form field must be supported by the selected candidate's
`<profile>/profile/01-candidate-profile.md`, source documents or confirmed CV.**
Shared guides and `profiles/example/` are formatting references, never evidence
about the person. A form answer must agree with their submitted CV and letter;
ask about a missing fact instead of inventing it.

All accuracy rules from `05-cv-templates.md` and `03-writing-style.md` apply unchanged.

## Field type: self-introduction paragraph

Usually 100–200 words, one paragraph, no formatting.

**Structure that works:**
1. Current status — what they are doing or completing now
2. The single strongest piece of evidence, with its number and scale
3. One line of trajectory: how they got here, if a pivot or specialisation is genuinely interesting
4. What they want next, connected to this employer's actual work

**Rules:**
- **Lead with the strongest evidence, not chronology.** A career history told in order buries the best material when the strongest work is recent.
- **Write one version per role type, not one for all applications.** The same history framed for a backend role and a data role are different paragraphs. Produce both, label them, and say which goes where.
- **Tie it to this employer in the final sentence.** Generic self-introductions are the default and read as such.
- **Count the words and state the count.** Portals truncate silently. Supply a trimmed variant and name which sentence to cut first.

## Field type: structured project entries

Typically **project name, role, start date, end date, description.**

**Project name.** Give the project a descriptive name, not the employer's name — "Warehouse Inventory Forecasting Platform" is a project, "Acme Corp" is an employer. Where a client is more recognisable than the employer, name the client only if the relationship is truthful (placed on-site with, delivered to).

**Role.** The candidate's role *on that project*, which may be narrower than their job title. Do not upgrade it.

**Dates.** The dates they worked on **that project**, which are not automatically the employment dates. If a role spanned two years but the named project occupied the later part, saying so is both more accurate and avoids misrepresenting how long the project took. Only narrow the dates when the candidate can say when the project actually started — never invent a boundary to improve the ratio.

**Description.** 100–150 words: what the system did and who used it, then the hardest technical problem and how it was solved, then the outcome with its number. Supply a **~60-word short version** as well; portals vary and the candidate should not have to improvise a cut.

**Scope discipline is stricter here than on a CV.** A CV bullet can be terse enough to be ambiguous about ownership. A project entry with the candidate's name and role attached reads as ownership of the whole thing. Where they contributed rather than owned, say so inside the description.

## Field type: hard character limits

These reward **a specific situation over an adjective**. Most applicants submit adjectives — "passionate", "fast learner", "team player" — so a concrete situation stands out by contrast.

**Method:**
1. Pick the single most distinctive true thing: usually a number, an unusual combination of backgrounds, or a problem shape that maps onto the employer's own work.
2. Draft 4–6 candidates at different angles.
3. **Count characters programmatically. Do not estimate.** Over-limit text is truncated mid-word.
4. Present all candidates with counts, recommend one, and say why.

Prefer the version that **maps the candidate's problem onto the employer's problem**, where a truthful mapping exists. That is what "stand out" is actually asking for.

## Output format

Save copyable answers to `form-answers.md` in this attempt's application archive, or `<profile>/application-forms/<safe-role-name>.md` for an untracked application. Keep separate applications distinct; never share an output across profiles.

Include:
- A header naming the employer and the roles it covers
- Each field, labelled, with word or character counts stated
- Short variants where limits may be tighter than expected
- **`NOTE TO SELF` blocks** for scope reminders and prepared answers to questions the content invites — clearly marked as *not for pasting into the form*
- A dates quick-reference, so date fields stay consistent without re-deriving them

## Verification before handing it over

- [ ] Every factual claim traces to the selected profile's candidate facts, confirmed CV and source documents
- [ ] No claim contradicts the CV or cover letter submitted for the same role
- [ ] Ownership scoped correctly on contributory work
- [ ] Word and character counts measured, not estimated
- [ ] In-progress qualifications described as in progress
- [ ] `NOTE TO SELF` blocks clearly marked as internal
